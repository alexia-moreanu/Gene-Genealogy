# Gene-Genealogy

#🧬 Decoding the Relationship Between Genes

Reconstructing genealogy relationships between mutated DNA sequences using local and global algorithmic strategies.

⸻

#📌 Problem Definition

Given a set of mutated gene sequences, the goal of this project is to reconstruct their genealogy (grandparent → parent → child relationships) using only sequence similarity.

The challenge is to determine how different algorithmic strategies influence the inferred evolutionary structure.

#⚙️ Solution Specification

I implement two distinct approaches:

🔹 Local Strategy (Greedy, Pairwise-Based)
	•	Compute pairwise similarity using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
	•	Convert similarity into a normalized distance matrix
	•	Construct a genealogy tree using greedy, local decisions
	•	Score the tree based on edge distances

This approach prioritizes efficiency and immediate proximity.

⸻

#🔹 Global Strategy (Optimization-Based)
	•	Compute global alignment scores using Needleman–Wunsch dynamic programming
	•	Convert alignment scores into distances
	•	Evaluate all valid tree configurations
	•	Select the tree minimizing a global objective

This approach evaluates the genealogy holistically, prioritizing overall consistency.

	•	Log–log runtime comparisons
	•	Mutation probability estimation (insertions, deletions, substitutions)
	•	Laplace smoothing for small-sample robustness
	•	Deterministic traceback for reproducibility

🚀 Why This Project?

This project explores the trade-off between local decision-making and global optimization in structured inference problems.

It connects:
	•	Dynamic programming
	•	Graph/tree reasoning
	•	Optimization
	•	Biological interpretation

It reflects my interest in building computational systems that translate raw biological data into interpretable structure.
